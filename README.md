# Django REST flashcards web app
Flashcards web application, based on Django REST.

**Project still under development and during improvement.**

Overall plan (evaluated during production)

- [x] REST skeleton e.g. models etc.
- [x] General visual aspects i.a. JS, CSS and HTML.
- [X] Construction of site tabs (views) and urls.
- [X] Implementation of users and authentication.
- [X] Cards management: add, edit and delete cards.
- [ ] Add new packs (decks) and remove whole decks (with all cards inside)

Future plans / issues to be solved:
