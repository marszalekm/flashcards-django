# Django REST flashcards web app
Flashcards web application, based on Django REST.

Some general features: 
* Users can add and delete whole decks or cards.
* User authentication - every user has 
it's own decks with cards and have no access to decks of other users. 
* Cards learning is managed with simple JS script. 

**Project still under development and during improvement.**

Overall plan (evaluated during production)

- [x] REST skeleton e.g. models etc.
- [x] General visual aspects i.a. JS, CSS and HTML.
- [X] Construction of site tabs (views) and urls.
- [X] Implementation of users and authentication.
- [X] Cards management: add, edit and delete cards.
- [X] Add new packs (decks) and remove whole decks (with all cards inside)
- [ ] Testing (especially forms).

Future plans / issues to be solved:
- [ ] Better esthetics, UX.
- [ ] _BUG_ - Users can add cards to other users decks. 
- [X] Possibility to hide a card from deck (not remove).
